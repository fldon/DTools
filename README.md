# DTools
Misc tools I mainly use in my other projects

## Build instructions:

Build using the top level DTools.qbs project file.

If unfamiliar with qbs, set up a sensible default profile and then execute

qbs install --install-root ./ qbs.installPrefix:

in the repo folder. The built library will be in the lib folder.
